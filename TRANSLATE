This file describes very briefly, how to translate hometape. We presume, that
you are familiar with the GNU gettext system and how to create translations with
it.
This file only describes how to create the translation templates.

1. If there is not already a file called 'hometape.pot' in the main directory of
   hometape, then you must create it. You can do this by executing the shell
   script 'create_gettext_template.sh'.

2. Create a .po file. You should execute 'init_translation.sh' with the language
   code as the first and only parameter (e.g. if you want to create a  german
   translation, then call "./init_translation.sh de_DE".)

3. Translate the new .po file (it is located in 
   'locale/{LANGUAGE_CODE}/LC_MESSAGES/hometape.po'.) with your favorite
   translation tool or a text editor.

4. Create the correspodenting .mo file by executing the script
   'format_translations.sh'

5. There is no step 5 :-).
