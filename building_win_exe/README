What are these files about?

"setup.py" is needed to create a Windows executable using
py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org/). If you want to create an executable, you have
to install py2exe and then copy this file into the main directory of
hometape. Then you have to run this command:
 python setup.py py2exe
Now you have a directory called "dist", where the executable and its
dependencies are stored.

"installer.nsi" is the script file for NSIS (http://nsis.sf.net). If you have
already created the executable file, you can generate a installer for
hometape. But you will also need "vcredist_x86.exe" in the REDIST directory.
